A sample implementation for a long-term project, DeepTherapy, that aims to build an intelligent system which guarantees:

- Bridge between psychotherapists and people with mental health issues, providing a stable communication and 24/7 control over patients.
- Detects different types of mental health issues and send weekly statistical reports to doctors. 
- Share good vibes with patients by sending motivational quotes, success stories, jokes, etc...
- Assure the share of knowledge between psychotherapists by providing them a space to share thoughts via research articles.

### **Sample Objective**

The purpose of the sample project is to extract negative and good words from a long paragraph and using Natural Language Processing approaches we can detect the overall good/bad result which is automatically linked to the user's mood (whether he is in a good mood or a bad mood).
