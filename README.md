A sample implementation for a long-term project, DeepTherapy, that aims to build an intelligent system which detects different types of mental health issues using Artificial Intelligence

### **Sample Objective**

The purpose of the sample project is to extract negative and good words from a long paragraph and using Natural Language Processing approaches we can detect the overall good/bad result which is automatically linked to the user's mood (whether he is in a good mood or a bad mood).


Check both cases below
